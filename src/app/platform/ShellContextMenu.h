// must be this thread's). `owner`: the launcher's window, in front; the

// (发送到, 打开方式) fill in through messages to it. `extended`: with the
// verbs Explorer adds for Shift+right-click. `picked` runs once an item was

// there what becomes of the launcher meanwhile (the command may show
// dialogs). Returns once the command, if any, was run.

// which key it was; and with a Chinese IME in its Chinese mode the Menu key's
// press reaches Qt as VK_PROCESSKEY (the IME's), so no key event comes at
// all, only the release's context-menu event. watchKeys subclasses the
// launcher's window (Qt's native event filters are not given key messages)
// and keeps the last key pressed, the IME's seen through (by its scan code);
